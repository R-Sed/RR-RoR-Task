# RR-RoR-Task
**RR-RoR-Task** is simple rails blog application.

It\`s open blog application. Everybody can complete simple registration form and post something, or add comment to existing articles.

Right now some of functions work not very well. For example - search. For now it take search parameter like one solid key, even if it consist of few words.

On main page, and user\`s page\`s only titles of articles are shown. One of the main goal for next updates is to add short preview.
